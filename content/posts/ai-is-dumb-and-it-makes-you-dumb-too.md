title = 'AI Is Dumb and It Makes You Dumb Too'
+++

I am the lead programmer for a local robotics team. As lead programmer, it's my
responsibility to train some of the rookies for this upcoming offseason so that
they can start individually contributing core robot code, and while I was
working one of these said rookies, I was trying to ask them questions to evoke
some thoughts about how to solve the issue I was helping them with. However, as
I'm speaking, this young rookie begins typing something, sees GitHub Copilot pop
up a suggestion, hits tab, and I have to quickly pivot into figuring a nice way
to say "that was wrong and it's wrong to use a tool like that while learning."

This student is otherwise a pretty good student. He shows up, he pays attention
(or at least, as much as a high school freshman can pay attention), and that's
all I can really ask of these students for now. But what struck me as intriguing
in this interaction was that this young student, who hardly knew the language,
was trying to use AI to help him code. For some reason or another, this student
felt compelled to install tools to write code for him, despite his lack of
experience and knowledge when it came to coding.

Now, how am I supposed to trust that this student knows what he's doing? We work
with 150 pound robots that can run across the field faster than most people can
run. We tune big, heavy, mechanical arms and elevators that can crush your
fingers in less than a second. It takes a serious amount of attention to detail
and experience to safely engineer a high performing machine, particularly in the
six week build period of our competition.

My concerns with the use of AI aren't solely for this niche interest, but also
in learning and productivity as a whole. As I mentioned earlier, this student is
not experienced with programming, and was having difficulties writing basic
function calls. However, because the AI did all the hard syntax for him, he
didn't have to worry about it. He didn't have to worry about the logic or how
ergonomic his code was either, and this is <i>terrifying</i>.

If inexperienced programmers feel tempted to rely on AI, how will they ever
learn anything? Almost all of my learning has come from fucking around and
finding out. AI removes the fucking around aspect, thus diminishing the amount
of finding out.

To revisit my niche example of robotics, though this would likely apply to many
different fields that involve programming, say our team is at a competition
after I've graduated, and the students have to fix a bug in the code. I imagine,
if these students are to continue learning with AI by their side, the process
would go something like this:
- Something goes wrong during a match
- "Fix that please"
- "I don't know how it works"
- "What do you mean you don't know how it works? Didn't you engineer the code
  for this robot?"
- "Uh... I sorta did... using my, uh... tools"

But AI is not only a problem for programmers still learning the basic constructs
of the language they have to work in. Even senior developers seem to be falling
for this trap. I recently read [an article from a senior developer detailing
their experience with
AI](https://generativeai.pub/the-junior-developer-extinction-were-all-building-the-next-programming-dark-age-f66711c09f25),
and it quite frankly shocked me. This developer admits to generating swaths of
code with AI, delegating their mentorship to ChatGPT, blowing off code reviews,
and it's stunning to see this behavior from a supposed veteran of the industry,
particularly when they're criticizing junior developers for doing the same.

What shocks me the most about this article are the supposed "solutions" this
author details. Such solutions include:
- "Explain It Back", where you pollute your code with comments on every AI
generated line explaining what it does, consuming twice the amount of time it
would have taken to just write the code normally
- "AI-Free Fridays", where the author encourages the reader to take off the
training wheels and learn something, as if being frustrated while learning is
atypical or dangerous
- My favorite one of all, "Actually Mentor", where the author literally just
says to not use AI to blow off your junior developers.

Here's a solution that works for every problem brought up in both my article and
his: *DON'T USE AI!* It baffles me that people act as though AI is simply
inevitable, and that if you don't use it, you'll get left behind in the
dust. This is simply not true. Who will develop AI tooling? Who will fix the
terrible architecture and bugs brought from shitty AI code? Who will be adapting
the codebase to new requirements? Who will be developing something new, and
therefore have no training data for AI to rely on? Who will stand up and call
out the bullshit developers are submitting and pretending to have written
themselves?

A story I was told when I took a course on HTML and CSS was about a [Reddit user
who forgot how to
code](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/programmer-automates-job-6-years-boss-fires-finds)
after automating his job for six years. He managed to fly by at the company he
worked for, making $95,000 a year, but his entire foundation was built on
lies. He pretended as though he was a hard working, trustworthy software
developer, but was in fact "using his tools" to do nothing at all (sounds
somewhat familiar, huh?).

I understand that the above example is an extreme, and you're not going to
completely forget all programming knowledge if you start using AI. However,
consider what you're doing to your brain with AI. In using it, you are creating
a dependency upon it. You are allowing your cognitive function to be offloaded
to the machine, and you are thereby diminishing your cognitive capibilities in
turn.

In order to properly learn and maintain your skills as a developer, it is
essential to understand that AI is a children's toy used for cheating on essays
and making Daniel Stenberg's life harder. By using AI in any significant
fashion, you are tossing your belief in your own abilities and the skills
required to maintain your knowledge into the dumpster and setting them on
fire. Don't listen to the tech bros using AI to make bots that dump out AI
videos on Instagram. Listen to what's right, and stop using AI for coding,
period.
